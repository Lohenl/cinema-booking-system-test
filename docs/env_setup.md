# Setting up the local environment

This page provides a reference on setting up a Python Virtual Environment in Visual Studio Code. It is based on my current setup which worked for me, and is being used for several other projects. YMMV. :)

## Requirements
- Windows 11
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Bash for Windows
- Python 3.12

## Getting Started

Due to time constraints, just:

1. Make sure the requirements are present and installed
2. Follow the references to have Bash in VS Code
3. Follow the references to set up a Python virtual environment in VS Code
